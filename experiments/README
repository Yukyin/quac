These directories contain code that coordinates experiments related to QUAC.
This can mean varying things, including a direct dependency on QUAC or
experimental functionality which is likely to find its way into QUAC.

The reason we provide this code is to further experimental reproducibility,
which is one of the core values of science.

This code is targeted at a different audience than QUAC itself and should be
considered even more "as-is". The goal is reliable experiments conducted on a
limited timescale, typically leading to one or more scientific publications.
Caveats include but are not limited to:

  * The code is completely unmaintained.
  * There is no documentation and no support.
  * There are no tests.
  * There is no attempt at portability.
  * The version of QUAC depended upon is not reliably recorded.

The experiments are organized by year, publication venue, and a short moniker.
More specifically, what is here:

Typically, experimental code is not included until after some publication
milestone, which could be anything from paper submission to final publication.

The license is the same as QUAC proper.
